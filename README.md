# AI Tic Tac Toe
Two algorithms implemented in Python 3 to create Tic Tac Toe AI games.
# Index
There are five python files, here are their uses:

 - A simple tic tac toe game between two humans with an algorithm implemented to check who wins.
 - A simple implementation of the Minimax where a human plays against an AI.
	 - A breakdown of the algorithm can be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/
- An AI which has been pretrained using Reinforcement Learning. The weights are preloaded in the trained_states text files.
	- A breakdown of what Reinforecement Learning is can be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-reinforcement-learning/
- A program where the AI plays against the Minimax algorithm.
- The final two files can be used to retrain and debug the AI with instructions provided in comments in the code. 
# Keep in Mind
Retraining the AI can always change if retrained.
# Requires
These python programs require **Python 3** and **numpy** to be installed.
